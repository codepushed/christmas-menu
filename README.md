# Christmas Menu Website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Menu Admin Feature

This website includes an admin page for managing menus. The admin page allows you to:

- View all existing menus
- Add new menus with multiple images or PDF files
- Update existing menus (rename or replace files)
- Delete menus

The admin page uses Firebase for storage and database functionality.

### Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Firebase Storage and Firestore Database in your project
3. Set up authentication rules for Storage and Firestore to secure your data
4. Get your Firebase configuration from Project Settings > General > Your apps > SDK setup and configuration
5. Update the Firebase configuration in `/firebase/config.js` with your own credentials:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
